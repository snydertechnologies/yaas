A few days ago we launched the **Bigcapital Cloud** service, and the early adopter plan to attract the first group of beta users who are willing to collaborate and refine the product. As we want to be a highly community-driven product, we’re looking for 200 early adopters to get more deep feedback on what we built and feature requests to reach to the product can satisfy the market, although we’ve built all the major features and reports that any accountant or business owner needs but we highly believe in tiny details, little tweaks or new report can make user’s life easier.

Being an early adopter has no specific requirement like being active or contributor to the codebase or giving feedback constantly, you can do that also by using the Bigcapital CE self-hosted, it’s free and has no obligation, but we believe since you subscribed early you’re part of early adopter users and your feedback and features requests will be always in priority.

### The Early Adopter Plan Includes
- You’ll get access to all features of all plans.
- You’ll get the ability to create other 3 organization accounts under the same email.
- Priority support on Discord and email.
- It's a **$29 one-time** payment for a year.

*The early adopter will be replaced with another monthly plan without full-features once the 200 seats run out but the subscripted users will reserve their privileges and support for a year.*
